This last month at Tokeny has been launch a challenge to reduce our carbon emission due to IT.
Here is things I've done to do so:

## Emails inboxes
- All my emails inbox are empty by default for several years now (but I do not receive that much compare to some of my coworkers)
- I archived the important ones on my NAS

## Browsing
- I installed [Ecosia](https://ecosia.org/) to my relatives.
- I won’t use another browse engine for myself. [Duckduckgo](http://duckduckgo.com/) is the best for my needs :).
- I unsubscribe every newsletter I don’t care about for many years now (and it has been the most effective anti-spam filter ever).
- I used to self-host my cloud infrastructure, but it’s a lot of work for a high availability… I’m relying on Google now. However, I'm pretty sure Google has a more efficient power management than I do so… I'm ok with that.
 
## Hardware
- I gave my personal computer to a charity organization (more at [Secours Populaire](https://www.secourspopulaire.fr/faire-un-don)) as I didn’t use it for a while (I'm not that player I used to be :( )).
- I plan to gave remaining useless hardware I own to a college.
- I (finally) sent my old smartphones (HTC Dream G1 and a Nexus 4) to a french company that will recycle them (more at [Morphosis](https://morphosis.fr)).
- I calculated the average lifespan of hardware at home. It is ~3 years. In details:
    - recent macbook pro: 1 year old
    - old macbook pro: 5
    - smartphone: 3 year old for both of us (my wife and I)
    - NAS (Raspberry Pi + RAID 0+1): 3 years old
    - Switch game console: 3 years old
    - No tv or anything else...
- My wife and I use to unplugged everything that is not needed (actually, we use switch on/off multi power-supplies).

It is probably missing things and is probably perfectible but that's the way it works at home today :) More challenges coming.

Take care
